# TestPlayer
This player was created as part of my master thesis, one day I'll revisit it and make it better? hopefully someone finds some solution in the source code, and a problem to that solution ;).
* Developed under gcc (MinGW on Windows) using FLTK, MAD mp3 decoder, portaudio, libsndfile, flac and ogg/vorbis
* Things to add: All-Pass and (eventually) other filters, a playlist.
* Things to update: code optimization, rebuild using MSVC.
